## NUX Device Support

### Pro devices (113-byte format)
`plugpro`, `space`, `litemk2`, `8btmk2` — full effect chain (Comp, EFX, Amp, EQ, NG, Mod, Delay, Reverb, Cabinet). 29 amp models, 25 cabs.

### Standard devices (40-byte format)
Implemented in `lib/server/qr-encoder.ts`. Each has its own encoder:

| Device | Encoder | Amps | Cabinet | Special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `plugair_v1` | `buildPlugAirPayload` | 13 (0-indexed) | 19 cabs (0-indexed) | EFX slot (13 types) |
| `plugair_v2` | `buildPlugAirPayload` | 13 (0-indexed, different) | same 19 cabs | EFX slot (13 types) |
| `lite` | `buildLitePayload` | 1 (AmpClean, id=0) | none | Single ambience slot (reverb OR delay) |
| `8bt` | `build8BTPayload` | 1 (AmpClean, id=0) | none | Separate delay + reverb slots |
| `2040bt` | `build2040BTPayload` | 1 (id=0) | none | Wah pedal, has bass/mid/treble EQ |

### Effect ID indexing
- **Pro devices**: 1-indexed (nuxIndex starts at 1)
- **Standard devices**: 0-indexed (nuxIndex starts at 0)
- All effect IDs, names, and ranges are in `lib/server/names.ts`

### Lite ambience slot
Lite BT uses a single ambience slot (byte 19) shared by delays (nuxIndex 0-3) and reverbs (nuxIndex 10-13 in the payload). The encoder adds +10 to reverb IDs automatically — use 0-3 in the AI tool call. Reverb takes priority over delay if both are provided.

### Source for standard format
Reverse-engineered from [mightier_amp](https://github.com/tuntorius/mightier_amp) Dart source. Key files: `lib/bluetooth/devices/NuxConstants.dart`, `lib/bluetooth/devices/effects/*/`.

## TODO / Bugs

- **BUG**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')` appears randomly in chat responses — intermittent, root cause unknown, likely a null/undefined message or chunk object not being guarded before accessing `.id`
- **TODO**: Add UI nudges prompting the user to set up their own BYOK and Tavily API key (e.g. banner or settings hint). Add a boolean in the settings pane to dismiss/stop the nagging once the user has seen it.
- **TODO**: Make the default free tier work with any configured API provider, not just Anthropic.
